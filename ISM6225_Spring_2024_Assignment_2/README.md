1.	Working on the problem of finding missing numbers in an unsorted array helped me understand in-place algorithms for efficiency. The approach of marking elements as negative to track present numbers enabled an efficient O(n) solution with O(1) space complexity. It was interesting to see how modifying the input array could simplify the solution and eliminate the need for extra data structures.

2.	Working on the parity sorting problem enhanced my array manipulation skills. I initially used a two-pointer approach, which didn't preserve order. Adapting to a temporary array allowed me to maintain the original positions of even and odd numbers. This reinforced the importance of thoroughly understanding problem requirements before coding.
